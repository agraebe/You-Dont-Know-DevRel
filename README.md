# You-Dont-Know-DevRel
A blog series on DevRel focusing on the misconceptions of the Developer Relations concepts.

Over the last years, I've come across many misconceptions abotu Developer Relations. I realized it's time to manifest these and provide clarification.
You can use these whenever you struggle sharing the vision of DevRel in your environment.

As a first step, I will collect common questions and try to answer them. My goal is to answer them not only from a purely DevRel perspective but also paint the bigger organizational picutre.
People around you don't mean to harm you with their questions, they legitimately try to understand the core work and the value.

Let's start ...

## What is the business value of DevRel?
The business goals of a Developer Relations team should be ...
- increase user empathy by releavilng shortcomings
- foster community-driven roadmapping by collecting needs
- increase awareness through speaking/writing/teaching/coaching
- increase adoption through developer on-boarding funnel analysis
- building and nurturing a developer community through engagement like events/meetups/webinars

## So, it's basically marketing?
A common misconception. If one would look at the business goals of DevRel, the conclusion almost always is that it's marketing.
It's not! The big difference is the approach, guided by a grea understanding of the target audience. In the early stages, DevRel in fact was referred to as Developer Marketing.
The only reason that DevRel became a widespread concept is that marketing for developers differs tremendeously from traditional marketing in many ways.

### What is traditional marketing?
I view traditional marketing as an approach that is supposed to ...
- capture interest of the target audience through empathy. For instance, focus on a pain point
- show how your product/platform is the best option
- try to sell your product/platform and be as covincing as possible
- upsell where possible, maybe the neat product features can get a few extra bucks even when the audience might not need them

The goal is to generate enough leads so that these can be converted into recurring, paying customers. Here's the crux: Most often, developer
are not the ones that make the business decisions. They have low buying power in an engineering org. Often, these developers get
told what product/platform they have to use because a buying decision was already made by someone else. When these developers start using a product with
horrible developer experience, it will end up badly. For the team, for the project and for the org. These developer will do eveything they
can to avoid using that product (again).

### A different approach
DevRel's core principle is to get developers hyped about a products so much that they become advocates. When the next project that requires a product like yours comes along, they
will be happy to outline the benefits for you. And, they will happily mention the benefits for them. Great experience, nice docs, SDKs, amazingly powerful and easy to use tools.

Here's what DevRel should do, to get there:
- capture interest of the target audience through empathy. For instance, focus on a pain point
- show the concepts and technological trends that help solve the pain point
- list and critically compare a set of products that follow these concepts and trends
- show step by step how to solve the pain point with your product
- provide a channel for support and feedback in case developer get stuck

The last points are is super important. Not many target audiences wander around thinking "What's the next cool skill I can learn?". Guess what, developer do that all the time.
It's critical for them to keep up with technology to be relevant a few years from now or be considered for their dream job. The is where traditional marketing fails. It's not abstract enough, it's not meant to help people to improve skills or learn new concepts, it's not objective.

Getting DevRel right is hard. It requires carefully hiring, focus on thought leadership, community building, openness in terms of product roadmap, focus on developer experiences, and a willingness to listen. Developers communicate unfiltered, get used to critical feedback and deal with it appropriately.
